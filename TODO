Improve Traversabiliy Loss: Check how to invert or even see if regeneration of data is necessary.
Check the mismatch of Risk and Depth image:
Use prepare data function instead of code in training and evaluation!: Done
Vladitation:
    - Compare loss to:
        - iPlanner (no Risk Image)
        - Mission (Path): Done
    - Get random goal selection in a cone and add fear loss to see how it performs there.
    - Load random data from from the internet or see if Taka can provide some.
If Time:
    - Try out different network
    - Try different dataset
    - Add data generation to repository
